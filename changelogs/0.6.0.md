## Overlay Vertex Consumers

Added a vertex consumer "wrapper" that lets you render an overlay over the original model,
with customizable offsets, animations, etc.

Comes with a ready-to-use ModelOverlayFeatureRenderer

## Extended Status Effect

For now does only one thing: lets you mark an effect as incurable. It won't get removed when
the player drinks milk.
